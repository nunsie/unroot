## Features
- **Serverless Architecture:** Unroot runs on AWS Lambda which is scalable and cheap.
- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express.
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing).
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./src/schema.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend.
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup.
